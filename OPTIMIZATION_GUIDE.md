# Document Q&A API Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the comprehensive optimizations made to the document Q&A API to improve accuracy and reduce response time to under 10 seconds.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Chunking with 30% Overlap ✅
**Problem**: Basic chunking was losing context between chunks
**Solution**: Implemented proper 30% overlap in semantic chunking
```python
def smart_chunk_text(text, section_name="", chunk_type="", max_chunk_size=512):
    """Enhanced chunking with proper 30% overlap"""
    from config import CHUNK_OVERLAP_RATIO
    overlap_size = int(max_chunk_size * CHUNK_OVERLAP_RATIO)  # 30% overlap
```

**Benefits**:
- Better context preservation across chunk boundaries
- Improved retrieval accuracy for questions spanning multiple chunks
- Maintains semantic coherence

### 2. Document Caching with URL Hash ✅
**Problem**: Repeated document processing was slow and wasteful
**Solution**: Implemented persistent document caching using URL hash
```python
class DocumentCache:
    def __init__(self, cache_dir="cache", max_size=100):
        # Cache documents with embeddings to avoid recomputation
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates repeated document parsing for same URLs
- Caches embeddings to avoid regeneration
- Configurable cache size with LRU eviction
- Persistent storage across application restarts

### 3. Hybrid Retrieval (Dense + Sparse) ✅
**Problem**: Single retrieval method was limiting accuracy
**Solution**: Combined dense embeddings with sparse BM25/TF-IDF
```python
def hybrid_retrieve(query, chunks, embeddings, top_k=5):
    # Dense retrieval (FAISS-like)
    dense_scores = np.dot(embeddings, query_emb.T).squeeze()
    
    # Sparse retrieval (BM25/TF-IDF)
    bm25_scores = bm25.get_scores(tokenized_query)
    
    # Combine scores with configurable weights
    combined_scores = (
        DENSE_WEIGHT * dense_scores + 
        SPARSE_WEIGHT * 0.5 * (sparse_scores + bm25_scores)
    )
```

**Benefits**:
- Better handling of exact keyword matches (sparse)
- Semantic understanding (dense)
- Configurable weights for different use cases
- Fallback to dense-only if sparse fails

### 4. Model Preloading at Startup ✅
**Problem**: Model loading was causing first-request latency
**Solution**: Preload all models when application starts
```python
def preload_models():
    """Preload all models at startup to minimize latency"""
    # Load embedding model
    _embedding_fn = SentenceTransformer(str(EMBEDDING_MODEL))
    
    # Warm up LLM APIs
    # Test connections to Gemini and Cohere
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates cold start latency
- Validates API connections early
- Better user experience for first requests

### 5. Enhanced LLM Prompt Engineering ✅
**Problem**: LLM responses weren't consistently evidence-based
**Solution**: Structured prompt with strict evidence requirements
```python
def build_llm_prompt(context, question):
    return (
        "You are an expert document analysis assistant. Answer the following question using ONLY the provided context. "
        "CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
        "1. Base your answer EXCLUSIVELY on the information provided in the context\n"
        "2. If the answer is not present in the context, reply: 'Not found in the document.'\n"
        "3. Do not make assumptions or use external knowledge\n"
        # ... more instructions
    )
```

**Benefits**:
- Consistent "Not found in document" responses
- Evidence-based answers only
- Reduced hallucination
- Better accuracy tracking

### 6. Performance Monitoring ✅
**Problem**: No visibility into system performance
**Solution**: Comprehensive performance monitoring
```python
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'response_times': [],
            'cache_hits': 0,
            'cache_misses': 0,
            'api_calls': {'gemini': 0, 'cohere': 0, 'fallback': 0},
            'errors': [],
            'accuracy_scores': []
        }
```

**Benefits**:
- Real-time performance tracking
- Cache hit rate monitoring
- API usage analytics
- Error tracking and debugging

## New API Endpoints

### `/optimized_query` - Enhanced Query Endpoint
**Purpose**: Main optimized endpoint with all improvements
```json
POST /optimized_query
{
  "url": "https://example.com/document.pdf",
  "questions": [
    "What is the grace period for premium payments?",
    "Is cataract surgery covered?"
  ]
}

Response:
{
  "answers": [
    "The policy provides a 30-day grace period for premium payments.",
    "Cataract surgery is covered up to $8,000 with 20% co-payment."
  ],
  "response_time_ms": 2340,
  "document_url": "https://example.com/document.pdf",
  "questions_processed": 2,
  "chunks_used": 45
}
```

### `/performance` - Performance Metrics
**Purpose**: Get system performance metrics
```json
GET /performance

Response:
{
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "average_response_time_ms": 2450,
  "cache_hit_rate": 0.75,
  "average_accuracy": 0.89,
  "total_requests": 150,

- Cold start latency: 0 seconds (preloaded)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
import requests

# Single question
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5001/optimized_query', json={
    'url': 'https://example.com/policy.pdf',
    'questions': 'What is the grace period?'
})

# Multiple questions
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5001/optimized_query', json={
    'url': 'https://example.com/policy.pdf',
    'questions': [
        'What is the grace period?',
        'Is surgery covered?',
        'What are the exclusions?'
    ]
})
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Get performance metrics
metrics = requests.get('http://localhost:5001/performance').json()
print(f"Average response time: {metrics['average_response_time_ms']}ms")
print(f"Cache hit rate: {metrics['cache_hit_rate']:.2%}")
```

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Deployment
1. **Environment Variables**: Set all API keys and configuration
2. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure sufficient RAM for model caching
3. **Monitoring**: Enable performance monitoring
4. **Caching**: Configure appropriate cache sizes
5. **Load Balancing**: Consider multiple instances for high traffic

### Azure Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"
export COHERE_API_KEY="your_key"

# Run with preloading
python app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Slow Response Times**: Check cache hit rate and model preloading
2. **Low Accuracy**: Verify hybrid retrieval is enabled
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce cache sizes in config
4. **API Errors**: Check API key configuration

### Debugging
```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Check performance metrics
curl http://localhost:5001/performance
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Vector Database**: Migrate to FAISS or ChromaDB for better scalability
2. **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for long documents
3. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for non-English documents
4. **Advanced Caching**: Implement Redis for distributed caching
5. **A/B Testing**: Framework for testing different retrieval strategies

### Research Areas
1. **Query Expansion**: Better query understanding and expansion
2. **Context Window Optimization**: Dynamic context window sizing
3. **Model Fine-tuning**: Domain-specific model fine-tuning
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple model ensemble for better accuracy

## Conclusion
